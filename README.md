# Task Manager Project

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! 

Thanks for coming to check out my project ðŸ™‚!

In this project, I wanted to hone my skills in responsive design, Sass, CSS Grid and Flexbox, psuedo-classes, and wanted to work on manipulating the DOM using JavaScript.

I decided to make a simple, elegant task manager to use in my spare time, and wanted it to be nice to look at. I consulted [freshman.tech](https://freshman.tech/todo-list/) for JavaScript reference, as I am still new to the techniques of adding event listeners and manipulating the DOM. While I certainly relied heavily on their guidance, I am now a lot more comfortable with event listeners and DOM manipulation.
